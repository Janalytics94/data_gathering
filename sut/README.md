# Simulation of Denial of Service Attack

Implementation of a SUT and a test component to monitor the process in order to collect data to determine normal behavior of our software. The main goal should be to determine normal as well as abnormal behavour of our software which might be an inidcator of a vulnerability. At first we will focus on the Denial of Service Attack.
